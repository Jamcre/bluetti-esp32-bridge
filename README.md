# ecolibrium2025-sensors

## Current problems 07/16/25
- integrate wifi hotspot and html logic to be compatable with data aggregation
- add antennae
- print a case
 
When this is done we can make our first deployment (maybe just one sensor module)


## Recently completed
- integrate GUI with SD card logic
- integrate RTC with that

# Changes
we changed partition to Huge APP (Tools -> Partition)
