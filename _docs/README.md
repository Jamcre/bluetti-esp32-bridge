# Project Goals
To develop a system for continous monitoring of indoor + outdoor air conditions and quality. We hope to use the gathered data to inform building retrofits to reduce carbon emmisions, harm done to people's health, and energy bills. 

## What we measure
We measure temperature, humidity, CO2, VOCs, NOx, PM1, PM2,5, PM4, and PM10 **avoid acronyms and add units!**. 

## How this can inform building retrofits
A "tight" building envelope (minimizing natural infiltration) often reduces the amount of active heating and cooling needed. However, this also leads to worse air quality since less outdoor air enters to replace pollutatns generated indoors by occupants and other sources **explain**. Our system can show these phenomena in real time and help diagnose the needs of a room. 

We use the system to understand the pollutant exposure over time for the interns working at Loisaida. When the indoor air quality is too low, we can open a door and use a fan to circulate fresh air into the room. This quantifies and mitigates pollutant exposure.
