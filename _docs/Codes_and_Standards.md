Usually standards regulate ventilation or filtration rather than pollutant levels so thats why there isnt much available.

## Ventilation Standards
ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2013.pdf - perscribes minimum ventilation rate (cfm/person, cfm/ft^2, L/s per person, L/s per m^2)

GRIHA IAQ Standard Limits and Thresholds.jpg - limits proposed by Indian research team. Does not include NOx or Pm4. Considers HCHO but not VOc's as a category.
Tentative CO2 recomendation of <1000 ppm

GRIHA Comparison of Regulations and Guidelines.jpg - image includes EPA, OSHA, WHO, and other recomendations.
